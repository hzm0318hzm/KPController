KPController
============

an easy way for developing complicated view controller

When develop our iPhone/iPad APP, I found that it's not easy to build a very complicated UI. Especiall several developer work together in a single UI.  So I decided to use key-path to make it easy.  We have used this in our project , and it really changed our work.
