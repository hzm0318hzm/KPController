KPController
============

an easy way for developing complicated view controller

When developing our iPhone/iPad App, I found that it's not easy to build a ViewController with very complicated UI. Especiall several developer work together on a single ViewController. It's difficult to manage those subviews and sub viewcontrollers. Before this, we use a lot of delegates to share data. It's very very verbose.  So I decided to use key-path to make it easy.  We have used this in our project , and it really changed our work.
